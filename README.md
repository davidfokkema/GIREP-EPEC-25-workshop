# GIREP-EPEC-2025-workshop
Workshop on Tailor for the GIREP-EPEC 2025 conference in Leiden.

When we teach students to perform physics experiments, we want them to compare
their results to a physical model. We found existing data analysis tools to be
lacking and built our own. In courses where we now use Tailor, we found that
discussions no longer focus on how to perform the analysis, but rather on the
outcome. The act of analysing data becomes a minor task and more time is devoted
to the physics behind the experiment. In the workshop we will explore how Tailor
can improve the teaching of experimental physics, both in high school and
college / university.
